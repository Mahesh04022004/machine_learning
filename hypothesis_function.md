🔶 PART 1: Hypothesis Function (in Machine Learning)
🔷 What is a Hypothesis Function?

In machine learning, a hypothesis function is the mathematical model used to predict outcomes based on input features.

Notation:
hθ(x)=θ0+θ1x1+θ2x2+⋯+θnxn
hθ​(x)=θ0​+θ1​x1​+θ2​x2​+⋯+θn​xn​

Where:

    hθ(x)hθ​(x): Hypothesis function

    xx: Feature(s)

    θθ: Parameters/weights

    This function maps inputs to outputs

🔹 Example (Linear Regression):

Let’s say you’re predicting house prices:
hθ(x)=θ0+θ1⋅area
hθ​(x)=θ0​+θ1​⋅area

If:

    θ0=50000θ0​=50000 (base price)

    θ1=1000θ1​=1000 (price per sq.ft.)

    x=1200x=1200

Then:
hθ(1200)=50000+1000⋅1200=1,250,000
hθ​(1200)=50000+1000⋅1200=1,250,000
✅ Goal in ML:

To find the best hypothesis function by adjusting parameters θθ to minimize error between predictions and actual values (using cost/loss functions).
🔶 PART 2: Hypothesis Testing (in Statistics & ML)
🔷 What is Hypothesis Testing?

Hypothesis Testing is a statistical method used to test assumptions (hypotheses) about a population using sample data.

It helps you make a decision:

    Is a claim (hypothesis) about the data true or not?

🔹 Two Main Hypotheses:

    Null Hypothesis (H₀):

        The default claim (e.g., no change, no difference).

        We assume this is true unless evidence suggests otherwise.

    Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ):

        The opposing claim (e.g., there is a difference, effect, or change).

🔹 Example:

You think a new teaching method improves scores.

    H₀: New method has no effect on average score.

    H₁: New method improves average score.

🔹 Steps in Hypothesis Testing:
Step	Description
1️⃣	Set hypotheses: H₀ and H₁
2️⃣	Choose significance level (α), usually 0.05
3️⃣	Select test statistic (e.g., t-test, z-test)
4️⃣	Calculate p-value
5️⃣	Compare p-value with α and accept/reject H₀
🔹 Key Concepts:
🔸 1. p-value:

    Probability of getting results as extreme as the observed ones, assuming H₀ is true.

    If p-value < α, reject H₀.

🔸 2. Significance Level (α):

    Threshold for rejecting H₀.

    Common values: 0.05 (5%), 0.01 (1%)

🔸 3. Test Statistics:

    Used to determine the p-value.

Test	When to Use
Z-test	Known variance, large samples
T-test	Unknown variance, small samples
Chi-Square	Categorical data
ANOVA	Compare means across 3+ groups
🔷 Subtopics in Hypothesis Testing
1. One-tailed vs Two-tailed Test

    One-tailed: Directional claim (e.g., mean is greater than 50)

    Two-tailed: Non-directional claim (e.g., mean is not equal to 50)

2. Types of Errors
Type	Meaning
Type I Error	Rejecting H₀ when it is true (False Positive)
Type II Error	Failing to reject H₀ when it is false (False Negative)
3. Power of the Test

    Probability of correctly rejecting H₀ when it is false.

    High power = lower Type II error.

4. Effect Size

    Measure of the strength of the relationship or difference.

5. Confidence Interval

    Range of values within which a population parameter lies, with a certain probability (e.g., 95%).

🔹 Real-Life Example:

Suppose a company claims their new battery lasts more than 10 hours on average.

    H₀: μ = 10

    H₁: μ > 10

From a sample, we find:

    Sample mean = 10.3

    p-value = 0.03

    α = 0.05

Since p-value < α, we reject H₀ and conclude that the battery lasts more than 10 hours.
📊 In Machine Learning Context:

    Used in feature selection (is this feature statistically significant?).

    Used in A/B testing (which model/algorithm performs better).

    Applied during model validation.
