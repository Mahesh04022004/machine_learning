🔷 1. Multilayer Network (Multilayer Perceptron or MLP)
✅ What is it?

A Multilayer Neural Network is a stack of multiple layers of neurons:

    One input layer

    One or more hidden layers

    One output layer

Each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer (called fully connected layers).
✅ Structure:

Input Layer → Hidden Layer(s) → Output Layer

Example:

    Input: Features like height, weight, age

    Hidden layers: Learn complex patterns

    Output: Predict something like "diabetes: yes or no"

✅ Why "multi-layer" is important?

    A single-layer perceptron can only solve linear problems.

    Multilayer networks with activation functions (like ReLU or sigmoid) can model complex, nonlinear relationships.

🔷 2. Backpropagation (Learning Algorithm)
✅ What is it?

Backpropagation is the algorithm that tells the network how to adjust weights and biases after each prediction to reduce the error.

It is based on:

    Gradient Descent

    Chain Rule of Calculus

🔁 Step-by-step Overview:

    Forward pass:

        Compute predictions using current weights and biases.

    Compute loss:

        Compare prediction vs actual label using a loss function.

    Backward pass:

        Compute how much each weight contributed to the error.

        Use chain rule to calculate the gradient (partial derivatives).

    Update weights:

        Apply gradient descent to change the weights and biases to reduce error.

🔣 Formula (simplified):

For weight update:
w=w−α⋅∂Loss∂w
w=w−α⋅∂w∂Loss​

Where:

    αα = learning rate

    ∂Loss∂w∂w∂Loss​ = gradient (from backprop)

🔄 Analogy:

Think of backpropagation like a teacher correcting a student's mistake:

    The student (model) answers a question (prediction),

    The teacher (loss function) checks it,

    Then gives feedback (gradient),

    The student updates their method (weights) to improve.

🔷 3. Weight Initialization
✅ What is it?

Before training begins, weights are usually initialized with random values. But how we initialize them matters a lot for how well the model learns.
🚫 Bad Initialization:

    All weights = 0 → All neurons learn the same thing (no learning)

    Large weights → Exploding gradients

    Small weights → Vanishing gradients

✅ Good Initialization Methods:
Method	Use Case	Description
Random Normal / Uniform	Basic networks	Weights are small random values
Xavier Initialization	Sigmoid/Tanh activations	Keeps variance the same across layers
He Initialization	ReLU activations	Prevents vanishing/exploding gradients
🔣 He Initialization (for ReLU):
w=N(0,2ninput)
w=N(0,ninput​2​
​)

This keeps the signal strength stable as it flows through the network.
