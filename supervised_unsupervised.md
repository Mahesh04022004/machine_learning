🔷 1. Supervised Learning
✅ What is Supervised Learning?

In Supervised Learning, the machine learns using labeled data, which means the input comes with the correct output (like answers in a test paper).

    🔍 Think of it like a student learning from a teacher. The teacher provides the correct answers, and the student tries to learn the pattern.

📦 How It Works:

    Input: Features (X)

    Output: Labels (Y)

    Goal: Learn a function f(X) = Y

📊 Example:
Hours Studied (X)	Marks (Y)
1	20
2	40
3	60

Now if a student studies for 4 hours, the model will predict ~80 marks based on the pattern.
📌 Types of Supervised Learning:
🔹 a) Regression (Output is Continuous)

    Predicts numeric values

    Examples:

        Predicting house price

        Predicting stock price

    Algorithm: Linear Regression, SVR

🔹 b) Classification (Output is Category/Label)

    Predicts class labels

    Examples:

        Spam or Not Spam

        Yes or No

        Digit recognition (0–9)

    Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN

✅ Real-World Applications:
Area	Application
Email	Spam detection
Finance	Credit score prediction
Healthcare	Disease diagnosis
Education	Student performance prediction
🔷 2. Unsupervised Learning
✅ What is Unsupervised Learning?

In Unsupervised Learning, the machine learns from unlabeled data, meaning it has no answers or outputs — the model tries to find patterns or groupings on its own.

    🤖 Think of it like a student who has no teacher and tries to figure out things by exploring on their own.

📦 How It Works:

    Input: Features (X)

    No output/labels

    Goal: Discover hidden patterns or structure

📊 Example:

Suppose you have shopping data for customers, but you don’t know who is a student, a businessman, or a retired person.

Unsupervised learning will group customers into clusters based on behavior.
📌 Types of Unsupervised Learning:
🔹 a) Clustering

    Grouping similar data points

    Examples:

        Customer segmentation

        Grouping animals by behavior

    Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering

🔹 b) Dimensionality Reduction

    Reducing number of features while keeping important information

    Examples:

        PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

        t-SNE (Visualization)

    Used to simplify complex datasets
